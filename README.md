# Product Landing Page

This is a freeCodeCamp Drum Machine Project.

The overall aim was to acheive a Drum machine Webpage, this was only focusing on using HTML, CSS, SASS and JavaScript to help me develop my front end skills further!

## <a name="userexperienceuX">UX (User Experience)</a>

This website was to help practice my SASS, HTML and JavaScript skills.

## <a name="userstories">User Stories</a>

### <a name="userstory_1">User Story #1</a>

- I should be able to see an outer container with a corresponding id="drum-machine" that contains all other elements

### <a name="userstory_2">User Story #2</a>

- Within #drum-machine I can see an element with a corresponding id="display"

### <a name="userstory_3">User Story #3</a>

- Within #drum-machine I can see 9 clickable drum pad elements, each with a class name of drum-pad, a unique id that describes the audio clip the drum pad will be set up to trigger, and an inner text that corresponds to one of the following keys on the keyboard: Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C. The drum pads MUST be in this order

### <a name="userstory_4">User Story #4</a>

- Within each .drum-pad, there should be an HTML5 audio element which has a src attribute pointing to an audio clip, a class name of clip, and an id corresponding to the inner text of its parent .drum-pad (e.g. id="Q", id="W", id="E" etc.)

### <a name="userstory_5">User Story #5</a>

- When I click on a .drum-pad element, the audio clip contained in its child audio element should be triggered

### <a name="userstory_6">User Story #6</a>

- When I press the trigger key associated with each .drum-pad, the audio clip contained in its child audio element should be triggered (e.g. pressing the Q key should trigger the drum pad which contains the string Q, pressing the W key should trigger the drum pad which contains the string W, etc.)

### <a name="userstory_7">User Story #7</a>

- When a .drum-pad is triggered, a string describing the associated audio clip is displayed as the inner text of the #display element (each string must be unique).

### <a name="sitegoals">Site Owner Goals</a>

- As a site owner I wanted to create and build a drum machine using JavaScrip, SASS and HTML

## <a name="wireframesboards">Wireframes</a>

As this was a brief project no wireframes were designed prior to building this site.

## <a name="featuressite">Features</a>

This section is a brief highlight of features that this site contains.

### <a name="maincontainer">Main Container</a>

- The main body is vertically and horizontally centered in the view port width
- Drum pads are in 3 columns and in three rows which are all mobile responsive
- buttons have a colour transform on hover over
- Buttons make an Audio sound according which is played either clicking or selecting the relvant key ont eh keyboard
- Display container changes depending on which button is pressed

## <a name="technologies">Technologies Used</a>

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

- The project uses the Bootstrap framework to add a responsive grid system, prebuilt components, plugins built on jQuery, and Bootstrap styles to my site, before adding my own custom styling 

[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

- The project uses CSS to apply the custom styles to create the look of my site.  The index.html file is linked directly to the main.css stylesheet

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/) 

- The project uses Font Awesome icons for all navigation and social media links that feature in the header and footer of my site

Google Chrome Dev Tools

- For testing purposes for responsive design

[HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

- The project uses HTML to create the basic elements and content of my site 

[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

- The project also uses JavaScript from Bootstrap which is required to add functionality to the Bootstrap, this also has additional javaScript to run the logic for the buttons to make the correct noise and display the relevant message in the display container.

[jQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery)

- The project uses jQuery to simplify DOM manipulation. This is both the standard jQuery that is built with Bootstrap components

[SASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language))

- The project uses SASS to apply the custom styles to create the look of my site.  The index.html file is linked directly to the main.css stylesheet

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

- I used Visual Studio Code as the development environment to write the code for my website

### <a name="versioncontrol">Version Control</a>

[Git](https://git-scm.com)

- I've used Git as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in Visual Studio Code, before pushing them to GitHub.

[GitHub](https://github.com)

- I've used GitHub as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website in a live environment.

## <a name="testingcases">Testing</a>

# <a name="functionalitytesting">Functionality Testing</a>

Browsers tested: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox & Opera.
The devices used in this testing include Samsung S10 v.Android 10.

## <a name="validationcode">Validation</a>

### <a name="htmlcode">HTML</a>

W3C testing completed for: index.html
No issues were stated.
 
## <a name="csscode">CSS</a>

W3C testing completed for: styles.css
No issues were stated.

## <a name="deploymentsite">Deployment</a>

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

-	Loaded the terminal window in my visual studio code workspace
-	Initialised Git using the Source Control in the control panel
-	Files that have been amended are automatically listed in the ‘Source Control’ panel
-	Add message in the ‘Message’ section, making sure the commits are clear and concise (re-checked previous commits for layout and what was fixed / still pending)
-	Click the ‘tick’ icon which stored the files in visual studio code
-	Click the ‘ellipsis’ icon and select the ‘push’ option
-	This then push all files and commits to the main branch
-	This will add the updated files into the ‘main branch’ option under the ‘GitHub pages’ section
-	Ran several commits after testing was carried out throughout my project.

### <a name="repositorylink">Repository Link</a>

[Drum Machine](https://elliej87.github.io/DrumMachine/)

### <a name="runningcodelocally">Running Code Locally</a>

To run my code locally, users can download a local copy of my code to their desktop by completing the following steps:

-	Go to my GitHub repository.
-	Click on 'Clone or download'.
-	Click on 'Download ZIP'.
-	Once downloaded, extract the zip file's contents and run my website locally.

## <a name="contentsite">Content</a>

This website was a quick and fun site for me to practice more web development skills and styling .

Background image was styled and designed by me.
